I don't want to talk about anything.
Not in the mood. Please go away.
Be silent. Don't talk.
I don't understand what you are saying.
I reserve my rights to not say a thing.
Do whatever you want to do and leave me alone.
Please do what I tell you to do!
Do you actually understand what I am trying to tell you?
